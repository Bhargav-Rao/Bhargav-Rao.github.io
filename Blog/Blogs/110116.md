Seven months after getting through the interview I was at the [Kempegowda International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempegowda_International_Airport), ready to leave for a two month long overseas trip to Halifax in Canada.

Getting an internship offer at Dalhousie University was nothing short of a surprise to me. Thanks, to Dr Kavi Mahesh, it was indeed a dream come true. I had been assigned to Dr Stan Matwin, a member of the Canada Research Chair and had to work in the domain of Big Data Analytics.
