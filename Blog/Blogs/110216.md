3D Visualization of ESRI Shapefiles in R has always been a difficult process. Not many have tried to visualize geospatial data in 3D. I have utilized [`maptools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html) and [`plot3D`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plot3D/index.html) for the following visualization. So we include the libraries

    library(maptools)
    library(plot3D)

First we use the `readShapeSpatial` function from `maptools` to read the shapefile. Remeber to point it to the `.shp` file. 

    ShapeFile <- readShapeSpatial('Test.shp')

<sub>I have used a shapefile of Atlantic Canada in my examples below</sub>

The `S4` object returned from `readShapeSpatial` contains a slot called `polygon`. This helps us get the co-ordinates to plot the different polygons. 

    Polygons <- slot(ShapeFile,"polygons")
    temp <- do.call(rbind, lapply(Polygons, function(x) slot(slot(x, "Polygons")[[1]], "coords")))


Create a dummy plot

    polygon3D(temp[, 1], temp[, 2], rep(0, nrow(temp)), col="transparent")

Finally we use `polygon3D` to draw the polygons. 

    for (i in 0:length(Polygons)){
        testpolygon <-  coordinates[coordinates$PolygonID == as.character(i),]    
        testpolygon$z <- 0 
        polygon3D(testpolygon$Longitude,
                  testpolygon$Latitude,
                  testpolygon$z,
                  add=TRUE)
    }


We now have our nice map.
