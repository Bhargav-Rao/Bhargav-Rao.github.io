            PROJECTS
            
            <ul>
                <li>Calculation of the diameter of Zone of Inhibition
                (Guide: Prof Mahendra M Nayak, May'14 - Till date)
                       <ul>
                            <li> <b>Objective</b> : To calculate the diameter of a particular zone of inhibition of antibacterials using OpenCV.
                            <li> The project is a multi-disciplinary project involving detailed programming using OpenCV.
                            <li> The project is aimed at the rural hospitals, which are financially backward (as the present device which
                does the same work is ten times the cost of the final product of this project).
            </ul>
                <li>Extracting information and Visualization of LAK Dataset
                (Guide: Prof Nitin V Pujari, Jul'14 - Nov'14) (<a href="Reports/Viz.pdf">Read project report</a>)
                       <ul>
                            <li> <b>Objective</b> : To extract information from the LAK-Dataset and visualize it using Cypher Text.
                            <li> To analyse the contents of the LAK-Dataset, convert it into a Graph DB and provide means of querying.
                            <li> The final project will be of great help to those researchers who will analyze the LAK Dataset.

            COURSE MINI PROJECTS
            <ul>
                <li>Implementation of First and Follow of a Simple Grammar. (Compiler Design)
                (Guide: Prof. H B Mahesh , Aug'14 - Dec'14)
                       <ul>
                            <li> Project work for partial credit involved the generation of First and Follow set of a simple grammar.
                            <li> It required a deep understanding of both recursive structures and modular programming.
                        </ul>
                <li>Hospital Management Systems (RDBMS)
                (Guide: Prof. Prafullata K Auradkar , Jan'14 - May'14)
                       <ul>
                            <li> Project work for partial credit involved creating an interface for Hospitals to increase efficiency.
                            <li> It included automating the system of admitting patients, enrolling Doctors and Nurses.
                       </ul>
                <li>Hospital Management Systems (Data Structures using Java)
                (Guide: Prof. Badri Prasad , Aug'13 - Dec'13)
                       <ul>
                            <li> Project work for partial credit involved creating an interface for Hospitals to increase efficiency.
                            <li> It included automating the system of admitting patients, enrolling Doctors and bill generation.
