            <p><strong><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2815725">Investigating the "Wisdom of Crowds" at Scale</a></strong></p>

            <p>Published in <a href="https://uist.acm.org/uist2015/about"><em>Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software &amp; Technology</em></a>.</p>

            <p>Abstract</p>

            <p>In a variety of problem domains, it has been observed that the aggregate opinions of groups are often more accurate than those of the constituent individuals, a phenomenon that has been termed the "wisdom of the crowd". Yet, perhaps surprisingly, there is still little consensus on how generally the phenomenon holds, how best to aggregate crowd judgements, and how social influence affects estimates. We investigate these questions by taking a meta wisdom of crowds approach. With a distributed team of over 100 student researchers across 17 institutions in the United States and India, we develop a large-scale online experiment to systematically study the wisdom of crowds effect for 1,000 different tasks in 50 subject domains. These tasks involve various types of knowledge (e.g., explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, and prediction), question formats (e.g., multiple choice and point estimation), and inputs (e.g., text, audio, and video). To examine the effect of social influence, participants are randomly assigned to one of three different experiment conditions in which they see varying degrees of information on the responses of others. In this ongoing project, we are now preparing to recruit participants via Amazon's Mechanical Turk.</p>

            <p>Abstract</p>

            <p>Large online libraries are now common across the Web. However these libraries are usually fragmented and are not semantically connected thereby making their search and access difficult. Also there are no large bibliographic Linked Open Datasets available for use in research and analytics. This paper shows how to create a large, comprehensive, RDF triple store of semantic data about books. The primary aim of this work is to establish a linked relation between all the available books in the world and connect them to the already available linked datasets. The Open Library dataset, which has over 45 million records is first serialized by converting it into a triple format and then linked together using predicates from different ontologies. A simple endpoint for a semantic book search engine called BookLOD is created to demonstrate the utility of the dataset.</p>

            <p>Abstract</p>

            <p>Bloom’s Taxonomy describes the classification of learning into various domains. The “Cognitive domain” tries to separate learning process into different levels based on the ability of a person to think. This is very helpful to detect whether a given question is memory based or application based. The primary aim of this paper is to demonstrate the utilization of Bloom’s Taxonomy to grade a given paragraph and the utilization of prediction models over that grading. This paper describes the technique to utilize the past marks of a student and the question paper contents to classify the question paper to a particular level using the taxonomic principles of the Cognitive domain and the application of linear regression to foretell the total marks that the student may score. This paper also describes various techniques in which Bloom’s Taxonomy can be applied and analyses the accuracy of each of those techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Calculation of the diameter of Zone of Inhibition</strong></p>

            <p>Published in <a href="http://iacc2016.com/"><em>6th IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC-2016)</em></a>.</p>

            <p>Under the guidance of <a href="http://cori.pes.edu/group/012">Mahendra M Nayak</a>, Associate Professor, PES Institute of Technology.</p>

            <p>Abstract</p>

            <p>In the Disk Diffusion Antibiotic Sensitivity test (The Kirby-Bauer test) a thin film of bacteria applied on a plate is subjected to various antibiotics. The Zone of inhibition is a circular area around the spot of the antibiotic in which the bacteria colonies do not grow. The zone of inhibition can be used to measure the susceptibility of the bacteria to wards the antibiotic. The process of measuring the diameter of this Zone of Inhibition can be automated using Image processing. In this work an algorithm is developed, using Computer Vision, which will detect the zones of inhibition of the bacteria . This work demonstrates an effective approach of measuring the Zone of Inhibition by calculating the radius of the zone by drawing contours and setting the right value of threshold. This work also determines if a particular bacteria is susceptible or resistant to the applied antibiotic using the calculated Zone of Inhibition and the prescribed standard values.</p>

            <p><strong>BookLOD - An Open Library Catalog as Semantic Data</strong></p>

            <p>Published in <a href="http://slp.org.in/lips2016/"><em>5th International Library and Information Professionals Summit 2016</em></a>.</p>

            <p>Under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ZVQV4CAAAAAJ">Dr Kavi Mahesh</a>, Professor and Dean of Research, PES University.</p>

            <p>Abstract</p>

            <p>Online Library catalogs are very common to find these days. Thanks to the digitalization of the literary works, many libraries have come forward, to catalog the list of books available on their shelves, online. However many of these are stored straightforward in tables and other similar data structures. Very few catalogs have tried to exploit the linked nature of the data to create either graph based catalogs or semantic catalogs. Hence there is no single large linked catalog of all the books that have been published. In this project we aim to create a single large curated semantic dataset after converting The Open Library Data dump, which is a comprehensive dataset of books with over 45 million records, to RDF. We present BookLOD - a web based graphical interface for easily extracting required information from the data using Semantic Web technologies such as RDF and Linked Open Data.</p>
